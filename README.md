The latest version of the script will be kept private.

The latest version of the script, named 5.1.2.py is a
script designed to analyse and visualise market data and relies on indicators
such as EMA, RSI and others to decide if it should buy/sell a certain asset
(in my case BTC).

As of today, the latest version of the script (5.1.2) has an average P&L/Trade of +4.5%.
