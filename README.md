# Market-Analysis-Bot

The most recent version of the script will NOT be released to public.
I will briefly discuss the wortking principles of the bot and proviode
you with a simple data gathering script which uses the krakenex API.

The latest version of the script, named Data_Visualisation_2.py is a
script designed to analyse and visualise market data and decide if it
should buy/sell a certain asset (in my case BTC). It relies on indicators
such as EMA with different lengths and should theoretically work with
any time frame.

As of today, the script has an average P&L/Trade of +0.83%.
